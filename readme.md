## üìñ Introduction

**CERA** (CE Runtime App) is multi-platform reference app for developers that demonstrates how to integrate the **Cellular Expert (CE) API** into ArcGIS Maps SDK applications. It is built using .NET MAUI allowing for multi-platform support, in a single codebase. 

With this project, developers can learn how to:
* Use the Quick RF Prediction API.
* Use the Profile Calculation API.
* Extend or adapt CE Express functionality in their own applications.


To run this application, you‚Äôll need access to:
* ArcGIS Enterprise portal
* CE Express API ([contact](https://www.cellular-expert.com/#Contacts))

üëâ A sample San Francisco dataset is included with CE Express installation.
